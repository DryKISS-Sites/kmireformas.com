We may process only minimal user data, only as much as it is absolutely necessary to maintain the Website and Services. Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.\n\nPrivacy of children\n-------------------\n\nWe do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us through the Website and Services, please contact us to request that we delete that child’s Personal Information from our Services.\n\nWe encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children’s Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission. We also ask that all parents and legal guardians overseeing the care of children take the necessary precautions to ensure that their children are instructed to never give out Personal Information when online without their permission.\n\nUse and processing of collected information\n-------------------------------------------\n\nWe act as a data controller and a data processor when handling Personal Information, unless we have entered into a data processing agreement with you in which case you would be the data controller and we would be the data processor.\n\nOur role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal Information.\n\nWe act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through the Website and Services. We do not own, control, or make decisions about the submitted Personal Information, and such Personal Information is processed only in accordance with your instructions. In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.\n\nIn order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be able to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:\n\n*   Send product and service updates\n*   Request user feedback\n*   Improve user experience\n*   Run and operate the Website and Services\n\nProcessing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.\n\nNote that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.\n\nDisclosure of information\n-------------------------\n\nDepending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any Service you have requested, we may share your information with our affiliates, contracted companies, and service providers (collectively, “Service Providers”) we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and Services available to you and whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect to Personal Information. We will not share any personally identifiable information with third parties and will not share any information with unaffiliated third parties.\n\nService Providers are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or comply with legal requirements. Service Providers are given the information they need only in order to perform their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose any of the provided information for their own marketing or other purposes.\n\nRetention of information\n------------------------\n\nWe will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce our agreements, resolve disputes, and unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.\n\nWe may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification, and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.\n\nData analytics\n--------------\n\nOur Website and Services may use third-party analytics tools that use cookies, web beacons, or other similar information-gathering technologies to collect standard internet activity and usage information. The information gathered is used to compile statistical reports on User activity such as how often Users visit our Website and Services, what pages they visit and for how long, etc. We use the information obtained from these analytics tools to monitor the performance and improve our Website and Services. We do not use third-party analytics tools to track or to collect any personally identifiable information of our Users and we will not associate any information gathered from the statistical reports with any individual User.\n\nDo Not Track signals\n--------------------\n\nSome browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The Website and Services do not track its visitors over time and across third-party websites. However, some third-party websites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you.\n\nLinks to other resources\n------------------------\n\nThe Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each and every resource that may collect Personal Information.\n\nInformation security\n--------------------\n\nWe secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of Personal Information in our control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (ii) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and the Website and Services cannot be guaranteed; and (iii) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party, despite best efforts.\n\nData breach\n-----------\n\nIn the event we become aware that the security of the Website and Services has been compromised or Users’ Personal Information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including, but not limited to, security attacks or fraud, we reserve the right to take reasonably appropriate measures, including, but not limited to, investigation and reporting, as well as notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities. In the event of a data breach, we will make reasonable efforts to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is a reasonable risk of harm to the User as a result of the breach or if notice is otherwise required by law. When we do, we will post a notice on the Website.\n\nChanges and amendments\n----------------------\n\nWe reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Website and Services at any time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification on the main page of the Website. We may also provide notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.\n\nAn updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Website and Services after the effective date of the revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes. However, we will not, without your consent, use your Personal Information in a manner materially different than what was stated at the time your Personal Information was collected.\n\nAcceptance of this policy\n-------------------------\n\nYou acknowledge that you have read this Policy and agree to all its terms and conditions. By accessing and using the Website and Services and submitting your information you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you do not agree to abide by the terms of this Policy, you are not authorized to access or use the Website and Services.\n\nContacting us\n-------------\n\nIf you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Policy, the information we hold about you, or if you wish to exercise your rights, we encourage you to contact us using the details below:\n\n[https://kmireformas.com/contact-us](https://kmireformas.com/contact-us)\n\nWe will attempt to resolve complaints and disputes and make every reasonable effort to honor your wish to exercise your rights as quickly as possible and in any event, within the timescales provided by applicable data protection laws.\n\nThis document was last updated on August 16, 2022","heading":"Privacy Policy"}],"seo":{"canonicalURL":"policies/privacy-policy","metaDescription":"Privacy documents are important for users to understand where we use data","metaTitle":"Privacy","metaImage":{"data":{"id":"64","attributes":{"alternativeText":"kmi-reformas.png","width":1200,"height":630,"mime":"image/png","url":"https://drykiss-strapi-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d.png","formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_kmi-reformas.png","hash":"thumbnail_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":245,"height":129,"size":46.2,"url":"https://drykiss-strapi-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/thumbnail_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d.png"},"large":{"name":"large_kmi-reformas.png","hash":"large_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":1000,"height":525,"size":551.33,"url":"https://drykiss-strapi-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/large_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d.png"},"medium":{"name":"medium_kmi-reformas.png","hash":"medium_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":750,"height":394,"size":330.41,"url":"https://drykiss-strapi-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/medium_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d.png"},"small":{"name":"small_kmi-reformas.png","hash":"small_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d","ext":".png","mime":"image/png","path":null,"width":500,"height":263,"size":161.82,"url":"https://drykiss-strapi-media.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/small_kmi_reformas_2463c1af1d.png"}}}}}}}}},"__N_SSG":true}
